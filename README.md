# computer-architectures-armv8
Computer Architectures projects (Fibonacci, Simple Calculator, Ackermann Function) implemented in ARMv8 assembly language.

**Run Environment:** DS-5 Workspace

**Fibonacci Number**:  
TASK: Write LEGv8 assembly code for a function that returns nth Fibonacci number.  
  
long int fib (long int n)
  
{  
  
...
  
}  
  
Example:  

fib(1) and fib(2) should return 1  

fib(3) should return 2  

fib(4) should return 3  

fib(5) should return 5  

etc.

**Simple Calculator:**

TASK: For this project, you will write a small calculator. Your calculator will have the capability to do the following operations on 4-digit decimal numbers (result is bound to 4 digits):  

- multiply  

- add  

- subtract  

- factorial (Accept only 1-digit numbers for factorial as input. If more than 1 digit is entered, return an error).  

- an operation of your choice. (I choose integer division)  

Your calculator.exe will continuously accept input, until you press the X button at any time.

**Ackermann Function:**
